## Introduction 
The Compressive Sensing project was developed as a fourth year capstone project at Carleton Univeristy by the authors listed at the end of this document. This project was developed over a span of 8 months with project planning, research and then development.

This ReadMe will walk you through the folders and files for the project as well as their functionalities along with how to execute them.

## Requirements
To run this project the user will require the following:
* Folders: C, HDL, Scripts, Testing
* Programs: Terminal with gcc or other C executers
* Operating System: Mac, Windows, Linux  

## C
This folder is composed of multiple C files used to run the OMP alogorithm, generate random numbers for the input signal, and test that the algorithm outputs the results that are expected using testbench.

#### Files in the C folder:
* OMP.c -
* OMP.h -
* phi.txt -
* phiGenerator.c -
* testbench.c -

## HDL
This folder contains

#### Files in the HDL folder:
